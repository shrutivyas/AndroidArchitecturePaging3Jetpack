# AndroidArchitecturePaging3Jetpack
When it comes to Pagination, we always remember traditional pagination where we used to do lots of boilerplate code for managing next and previous API calls and recyclerView scroll listener in every UI component.  Where Android Jetpack Paging 3 library provides pagination where we can write separate API calls logic, loading state, retry mechanism and Paging library takes care of the calling API in advance with in-memory caching so our code looks more elegant, readable, and testable.  The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently. The components of the Paging library are designed to fit into the recommended Android app architecture, integrate cleanly with other Jetpack components, and provide first-class Kotlin support. official documentation
